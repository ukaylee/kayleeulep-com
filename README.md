## ✨ Overview

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website. The site is a responsive, high-performance platform designed to showcase my technical projects, experience, and development philosophy.

The goal was to build a modern application from the ground up to demonstrate proficiency in a highly-valued, end-to-end development stack.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features

This project was architected with a focus on maintainability, type-safety, and deployment automation:

- **Type-Safe Development:** Built entirely with **TypeScript** to ensure code stability and catch errors during development rather than at runtime.
- **Responsible AI Integration:** Developed in accordance with my **AI Integration Philosophy**, leveraging generative tools for efficient **debugging** and **boilerplate code generation** while maintaining full code ownership and rigorous manual review.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Deployed the portfolio on **Vercel** for automated builds and hosting. Every push to the main branch triggers a new build and live update.
- **Segregated Architecture for Maintainability:** Designed the application for maximum maintainability by segregating **code logic**, **content** (managed via dedicated **JSON data structures**), and **styling** (managed via Tailwind CSS) to simplify future updates and content management.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses **Tailwind CSS** utility classes to ensure a pixel-perfect, mobile-first experience across all viewports.
