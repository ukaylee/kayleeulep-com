    "I embrace artificial intelligence tools to enhance my productivity and accelerate learning, always grounding my work in <span class='font-bold'>integrity, critical thinking, and ownership.</span> I view AI as a powerful co-pilot, not an autonomous replacement for human judgment.",
    "My core commitment is to the quality and authenticity of the final product. Every line of code, design choice, and written statement is ultimately <span class='font-bold'>owned, reviewed, and validated by me.</span> Leveraging AI to misrepresent my capabilities or experiences is fundamentally opposed to my guiding principles."

    "story": [
      "My user-focused approach is best demonstrated by <span class='font-bold'>SkySong</span>, a web application that began as a solution for a real need I identified as a musician. I designed and built an interactive sheet music and audio playback app, making it easier for users to learn harmonies and sing with confidence.",
      "I reduced chorus members' individual part learning time by <span class='font-bold'>80%</span> after implementing beta-testing feedback from over 20 users, validating the product's high user impact. I took <span class='font-bold'>full ownership</span> of the entire product lifecycle, maintaining the platform, addressing bugs, and prioritizing enhancement requests.",
      "My roadmap (including features like copyright protection) reflects my commitment to building ethically and anticipating future user needs. This project reinforced my belief that impactful software is born from <span class='font-bold'>persistence, empathy, and a creative spark.</span>"
